# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.





1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: A parameter is a reusable placeholder in a function because it can be replaced with different arguments. An argument is all of the different types of variables and data that will replace every occurrence of the parameter within the function.

  Researched answer:
  Something more concise that I found that I liked is that a parameter is defined instances of the argument occurring, and argument is the actual values that is actually being passed through the function in its place.





2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer:
  I'm pretty sure .map is a higher order function, which is a more abstract complex type of built in method. The three predefined parameters of .map() are value, index, and array. I think value, being the first parameter would be required. After that, index and array are optional. Similar to other parameters, parameter names do not matter as they are placeholders and .map() will always map in order of value, index, and array, each separated by commas.

  Researched answer:
  Something I could have included is that a .filter will naturally use conditionals to acquire the new information, while .map is going to use some type of operator.





3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer:
  Both .map and .filter are Higher-Order Functions that take the same three parameters, but .filter will aid in returning a new smaller array of only the specified content.

  Researched answer:
  I might have done well to include the idea that each iterate through the entire array. Similar I said, the purpose of .filter is to acquire certain data from an array that is further specified. map however, will return the same size array with all of the contents operated on.





4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer:
  I remember that a method is a type of function. I also remember that there are built in methods that are a part of JavaScript. In my own previous research I found out that .log is a built in method.

  Researched answer:
   More specifically than functions, methods are object oriented, which is to say they're associated with the object they're contained in. It is called by its object name and followed by the method name by way of dot notation. This includes the invocation method "this." Dissimilarly, a functions is simply called by its declared name. Something that has helped me understand methods a little more is that, to my understanding, .log() is just a method of the object console, which I found super neat. It helped put the language into context a little bit more.  





5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer:
  Destructuring is sorting an object in to smaller, more specific properties to be called on individually. From what I've gathered so far, the more specific the properties, the easier it might be to separate the data and call on only what you want.

  Researched answer:
  From what I understand, destructuring provides an easier way to access the properties of an object or array and assign them to local variables as to not get bogged down by .dot notation.





6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer
  I must have missed hoisting in the lecture, but from what I know of the word itself, it could have something to do with moving something up.

  Researched answer:
  I read that hosting means moving your invocations of a variable or a function to the top. This seems ineffective with plain variables because they will come return an output of undefined until they have been declared and assigned a value. With functions; however, you seem to be able to invoke them before they are declared through the process of hoisting.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: This seems to have something to do with extends keyword and lets objects share methods between each other.

2. React: React is a Javascript Library and UI tool made by Facebook that gives rapid feedback based on planned user interactions.

3. React state: An object that is just behind a webpage that uses react to re render without refreshing the entire page.

4. React lifecycle methods: They fall into four different categories. Mounting, updating, unmounting, and error. Mounting is the process of adding a component to a document object model. The updating refers to the rerendering or not rerendering a component if it is interacted with. Unmounting is the process of removing a component from your document. An error is likely when any of these processes go wrong.

5. DOM: Document object model, not to be confused with a virtual DOM or a VDOM which, from what I gathered, kind of works like an advent calendar. The components are there, but when you interact with one it could be like opening the door on the advent calendar and seeing the item that was always there, just directly underneath or behind it.
